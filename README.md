**Scratch Blocks to Python Converter with Pydiode Evaluation**

## Introduction

Obo Blocks is a project aimed at easing the transition from visual programming to text-based programming, specifically targeting students and teachers at [Roboticgen Academy](https://roboticgenacademy.com/). This tool enables users to convert programs written in Scratch Blocks into Python code and provides code interpretation using Pydiode. Additionally, it supports micropython extensions for running Python code directly within the web interface.

## Features

- **Block-to-Code Conversion :** Convert Scratch Blocks programs into equivalent Python code.
- **Code Evaluation :** Interpret Python code within the platform using Pydiode for instant feedback.
- **Micropython Extension :** Run micropython code directly within the platform.
